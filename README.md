## Hello! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/vFKqnCdLPNOKc/giphy.gif" width="40" height="40" />
I'm extraes, I used javascript and typescript, but these days I mostly use c#. The JS and TS were mostly just for Discord bots, and I've been using c# in modding Unity games, namely BONELAB and formerly BONEWORKS.
